## Introduction

In our previous lecture, we explored gradient descent for minimizing the least squares objective. We saw how following the negative gradient leads us to the optimal solution, even for large-scale problems where direct methods fail. But least squares is just one example of a loss function. Modern machine learning employs a vast array of loss functions, each designed for specific tasks: cross-entropy for classification, Huber loss for robust regression, contrastive loss for similarity learning.

The power of PyTorch lies in its ability to compute gradients for any differentiable function constructed from its operations. This lecture explores how to harness this capability, starting with simple one-dimensional examples and building up to complex neural network losses. We'll see how PyTorch's automatic differentiation system tracks computations, computes gradients efficiently, and helps us avoid common pitfalls.

## Computing Gradients of Loss Functions

Let's start with the simplest possible case: computing the gradient of a one-dimensional function. Consider the polynomial:

$$ f(x) = x^3 - 3x $$

This function has an analytical gradient:

$$ \frac{d}{dx}f(x) = 3x^2 - 3 $$

While we can compute this derivative by hand, PyTorch offers a powerful alternative - automatic differentiation. Here's how it works:

```python
import torch

# Create input tensor with gradient tracking
x = torch.tensor([1.0], requires_grad=True)

# Define and compute function
def f(x):
    return x**3 - 3*x

y = f(x)

# Compute gradient
y.backward()

print(f"At x = {x.item():.1f}")
print(f"f(x) = {y.item():.1f}")
print(f"f'(x) = {x.grad.item():.1f}")  # Should be 3(1)Â² - 3 = 0
```

This simple example reveals the key components of automatic differentiation:

1. **Gradient Tracking**: We mark tensors that need gradients with `requires_grad=True`
2. **Forward Pass**: PyTorch records operations as we compute the function
3. **Backward Pass**: The `backward()` call computes gradients through the recorded operations
4. **Gradient Access**: The computed gradient is stored in the `.grad` attribute


Let's visualize how the function and its gradient behave:

![Polynomial and Gradient](figures/polynomial_gradient.png)
The top plot shows our function $f(x) = x^3 - 3x$, while the bottom plot compares PyTorch's computed gradient (red solid line) with the analytical gradient $3x^2 - 3$ (green dashed line). They match perfectly, confirming that PyTorch computes exact gradients. To understand how PyTorch achieves this precision, we need to examine the machinery that powers its automatic differentiation system.

### The Computational Graph

To understand how PyTorch computes these gradients, we need to examine the computational graph it builds during the forward pass:

![Computational Graph](figures/polynomial_computation.png)

Each node in this graph represents an operation:
1. Input node stores our value $x$
2. Power node computes $x^3$
3. Multiply node computes $-3x$
4. Add node combines terms to form $x^3 - 3x$
5. Gradient node computes derivatives during backward pass


During the forward pass, PyTorch:
1. Records each operation in sequence
2. Stores intermediate values
3. Maintains references between operations

During the backward pass, it:
1. Starts at the output node
2. Applies the chain rule through the graph
3. Accumulates gradients at each node
4. Stores the final result in `x.grad`

This graph structure explains a crucial requirement: we can only compute gradients through operations that PyTorch implements. The framework needs to know both:
1. How to compute the operation (forward pass)
2. How to compute its derivative (backward pass)

Common operations like addition (`+`), multiplication (`*`), and power (`**`) are all implemented by PyTorch. Even when we use Python's standard operators, we're actually calling PyTorch's overloaded versions that know how to handle both computation and differentiation.

After constructing the computational graph, PyTorch provides two methods for gradient computation. Each serves distinct use cases in machine learning workflows.

The standard `backward()` method integrates directly with PyTorch's training infrastructure:

```python
x = torch.tensor([1.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x**3 - 3*x
y.backward()
gradient = x.grad  # Gradient stored in tensor's grad attribute
```

This method stores gradients in the tensors themselves through the `.grad` attribute. The storage mechanism makes it efficient for training neural networks, where we repeatedly compute and apply gradients to the same parameters. The trade-off comes in memory usage - gradients persist in memory and accumulate across backward passes unless explicitly cleared.

For cases where persistent gradient storage isn't needed, PyTorch offers the functional `torch.autograd.grad`:

```python
x = torch.tensor([1.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x**3 - 3*x
gradient = torch.autograd.grad(y, x)[0]  # Gradient returned directly
```

This method computes and returns gradients without modifying tensor state. It uses less memory since gradients don't persist, but requires more explicit gradient management in training loops. The functional approach particularly suits scenarios like computing higher-order derivatives or when you need temporary gradient values.

The methods compute mathematically identical gradients but differ in how they handle the results:

- `backward()`: 
  - Stores gradients in `.grad` attributes
  - Integrates naturally with optimizers
  - Requires gradient zeroing between steps
  - Uses more memory due to gradient storage

- `torch.autograd.grad`:
  - Returns gradients without storage
  - Provides cleaner functional interface
  - Avoids gradient accumulation issues
  - Requires manual gradient handling

The choice between methods typically depends on your training setup. Use `backward()` for standard training loops where you update parameters repeatedly. Use `torch.autograd.grad` for one-off gradient computations or when you need more control over gradient flow.

These gradient computation methods form the foundation for building neural networks in PyTorch. The framework provides `torch.nn.Module` as a structured way to combine these operations into reusable model components. Let's examine how this works.

### Common Pitfalls in Automatic Differentiation

While PyTorch's automatic differentiation is powerful, several common mistakes can break gradient computation or lead to unexpected behavior. Let's examine these pitfalls and their solutions:


#### 1. Breaking the Computational Graph

The most common mistake occurs when accidentally breaking the chain of computation that PyTorch uses to track gradients:

```python
# Wrong: breaks computational graph
x = torch.tensor([1.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x * 2
z = y.detach()  # Breaks the graph!
w = z * 3
w.backward()  # x.grad will be None

# Right: maintain computational graph
x = torch.tensor([1.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x * 2
w = y * 3
w.backward()  # x.grad will be 6
```
![Common Pitfalls](figures/pitfalls.png)


The `detach()` method creates a new tensor that shares the same data but detaches it from the computation history. This breaks the chain of operations needed for gradient computation. The top diagram shows correct gradient flow, while the middle diagram shows how `detach()` breaks this flow.

#### 2. In-Place Operations

In-place operations (modifying a tensor directly) can break gradient computation, as shown in the bottom diagram:

```python
# Wrong: in-place operation
x = torch.tensor([1.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x * 2
y += 1  # In-place operation breaks graph
y.backward()  # Error!

# Right: create new tensor
x = torch.tensor([1.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x * 2
y = y + 1  # Creates new tensor
y.backward()  # Works correctly
```

In-place operations modify the tensor's memory directly, which can invalidate the computational graph. Instead, create a new tensor to store the result.

#### 3. Gradient Accumulation

Gradients accumulate by default - if you don't clear them, multiple backward passes add up:

```python
x = torch.tensor([1.0], requires_grad=True)
for _ in range(3):
    y = x * 2
    y.backward()  # Gradients accumulate!
print(x.grad)  # Prints 6 (2 + 2 + 2)

# Solution: Clear gradients between computations
x = torch.tensor([1.0], requires_grad=True)
for _ in range(3):
    x.grad = None  # Clear gradients
    y = x * 2
    y.backward()
print(x.grad)  # Prints 2
```

This behavior is actually useful for accumulating gradients over multiple batches, but you need to be aware of it to avoid unintended accumulation.

#### 4. Scalar vs Vector Backward

PyTorch expects scalar outputs for `backward()` by default. For vector outputs, you need gradients of the same shape:

```python
# Wrong: vector output without gradient
x = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0]], requires_grad=True)
y = x * 2
y.backward()  # Error: grad can be implicitly created only for scalar outputs

# Right: provide gradient for vector output
x = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0]], requires_grad=True)
y = x * 2
y.backward(torch.ones_like(y))  # Works!
```

This requirement ensures that gradient computation is well-defined - for vector outputs, we need to specify how to weight each component's contribution to the gradient.

#### 5. Memory Management

Keeping computational graphs in memory can consume significant RAM. Use `torch.no_grad()` when you don't need gradients:

```python
# Wasteful: tracks gradients during evaluation
def evaluate(model, data):
    return model(data)

# Efficient: disables gradient tracking
def evaluate(model, data):
    with torch.no_grad():
        return model(data)
```

The `no_grad()` context manager temporarily disables gradient computation, reducing memory usage and speeding up computation when gradients aren't needed (like during model evaluation).

These pitfalls highlight important aspects of PyTorch's automatic differentiation:
1. The computational graph must remain connected
2. Operations must preserve gradient information
3. Memory management requires explicit consideration
4. Gradient computation needs well-defined scalar objectives

Understanding these issues helps write correct and efficient code for gradient-based optimization. With this foundation in automatic differentiation, we can now apply these concepts to practical machine learning problems, starting with the familiar least squares optimization we encountered in the previous lecture.

### Beyond One Dimension: Revisiting Least Squares

Our one-dimensional example demonstrated PyTorch's automatic differentiation on a simple function. Now let's return to the least squares problem we solved in the previous lecture, but this time using PyTorch's automatic differentiation. Given a data matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ and observations $y \in \mathbb{R}^n$, we differentiate the least squares loss:

$$ f(w) = \frac{1}{2n}\|Xw - y\|_2^2 = \frac{1}{2n }\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i^\top w - y_i)^2 $$

In the previous lecture, we derived the gradient manually:

$$ \nabla f(w) = X^\top(Xw - y)/n $$

PyTorch can compute this gradient automatically:

```python
# Convert data to PyTorch tensors
X = torch.tensor(X_data, dtype=torch.float32)
y = torch.tensor(y_data, dtype=torch.float32)
w = torch.zeros(X.shape[1], requires_grad=True)  # Initialize weights

# Compute loss
predictions = X @ w
loss = 0.5 * torch.mean((predictions - y)**2)

# Compute gradient
loss.backward()
print(f"PyTorch gradient: {w.grad}")
```

Under the hood, PyTorch computes the gradient using the computational graph we discussed earlier:

![Least Squares Computational Graph](figures/least_squares_computation.png)

This graph shows how PyTorch breaks down the least squares computation into elementary operations:
1. Matrix multiplication to form predictions $Xw$
2. Subtraction to compute residuals $Xw - y$
3. Squared norm to measure error $\|Xw - y\|^2$
4. Scaling by $\frac{1}{2n}$ to form the final loss
5. Backward pass to compute the gradient $X^T(Xw - y)/n$

To verify that PyTorch computes the correct gradient, we can compare it with our manual calculation:

![Least Squares Comparison](figures/least_squares_comparison.png)

The figure shows the contours of the least squares loss function for a simple 2D problem. At three different points (marked in red, blue, and green), we compute gradients using both manual calculation (left) and PyTorch's automatic differentiation (right). The arrows show the negative gradient direction at each point - the direction of steepest descent. The gradient computed by PyTorch matches the manual calculation, confirming that PyTorch computes the correct gradient.



### More Complex Loss Functions: Building Neural Networks

While least squares provides a clean introduction to gradient computation, modern machine learning requires more sophisticated models. PyTorch's `torch.nn.Module` provides a structured way to build these models. Let's examine how PyTorch implements neural networks, focusing on a simple two-layer network.


Key components of PyTorch's implementation:

1. **Parameter Management**: Each layer inherits from `nn.Module` and automatically registers its parameters:
   ```python
   class Linear(nn.Module):
       def __init__(self, in_features, out_features):
           self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(out_features, in_features))
           self.bias = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(out_features))
   ```
   These parameters are automatically tracked for gradient computation.

2. **Forward Computation**: The forward pass flows from input to output:
   - Linear layers compute z = xW^T + b (note the transpose for efficiency)
   - Activation functions introduce nonlinearity
   - Each operation maintains references for the backward pass

3. **Gradient Computation**: During `backward()`:
   - PyTorch builds a dynamic computation graph
   - Gradients flow through all intermediate values
   - Each parameter's gradients accumulate in its `.grad` buffer
   - The graph is released after backward to save memory

4. **Training Loop Structure**:
   ```python
   for batch in dataloader:
       optimizer.zero_grad()           # Clear gradient buffers
       output = model(batch.x)         # Forward pass
       loss = criterion(output, batch.y)# Compute loss
       loss.backward()                 # Compute gradients
       optimizer.step()                # Update parameters
   ```

This structure enables efficient training by:
1. Automatically tracking parameters and gradients
2. Computing gradients through arbitrary operations
3. Managing memory by releasing intermediate values
4. Enabling easy model composition and reuse

This structure extends naturally to more complex architectures. For binary classification, we build a similar model but with different output transformation and loss:

$$ p(y=1|x) = \sigma(w_2^\top \tanh(W_1x + b_1) + b_2) $$

where $\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$ is the sigmoid function. The cross-entropy loss measures prediction quality:

$$ L(w) = -\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n [y_i \log p(y_i|x_i) + (1-y_i)\log(1-p(y_i|x_i))] $$

The implementation mirrors our mathematical description:

```python
class NeuralClassifier(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size=10):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear1 = torch.nn.Linear(2, hidden_size)    # Input â Hidden
        self.linear2 = torch.nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)    # Hidden â Output
    
    def forward(self, x):
        h = torch.tanh(self.linear1(x))                   # Hidden features
        return torch.sigmoid(self.linear2(h))             # Probability output

# Training
model = NeuralClassifier()
y_pred = model(X)                                        # Forward pass
loss = torch.nn.functional.binary_cross_entropy(y_pred, y) # Loss computation
loss.backward()                                          # Gradient computation
```

This modular design lets us:
1. Define complex models by composing simple layers
2. Automatically compute gradients through any differentiable computation
3. Focus on model architecture without worrying about gradient calculations
4. Easily modify architectures by changing layers or activation functions

## Applying Gradient Descent

With PyTorch's automatic differentiation handling gradient computation, we can implement gradient descent directly. The algorithm follows three essential steps:

1. Forward Pass: Compute predictions and loss
   - Feed data through the model to compute predictions
   - Calculate the loss between predictions and true labels
   - For example, in linear regression: $L(w) = \frac{1}{2n}\|Xw - y\|_2^2$

2. Backward Pass: Compute gradients
   - Call `loss.backward()` to compute gradients via backpropagation
   - PyTorch automatically handles the chain rule through all operations
   - The gradient $\nabla L(w)$ tells us how to adjust each parameter

3. Parameter Update: Apply gradients
   - Update parameters using $w \leftarrow w - \alpha \nabla L(w)$ where $\alpha$ is the learning rate
   - Zero gradients with `param.grad.zero_()` to prevent accumulation from previous steps
   - Repeat until convergence or for a fixed number of steps

Let's implement this pattern for linear regression, comparing manual gradient computation with PyTorch's automatic differentiation:

```python
# Generate synthetic data
torch.manual_seed(42)
X = torch.randn(100, 2)
w_true = torch.tensor([1.0, -0.5])
y = X @ w_true

# Manual gradient descent
def manual_gradient(X, y, w):
    # Gradient of 0.5 * ||Xw - y||^2 / n is X^T(Xw - y) / n
    return X.T @ (X @ w - y) / X.shape[0]  # Normalize by batch size

w_manual = torch.zeros(2)
losses_manual = []
ws_manual = []
lambda_max = torch.linalg.svdvals(X)[0]**2
alpha = X.shape[0]*1.8/lambda_max # Stepsize rate
print(alpha)
max_iter = 100
for step in range(max_iter):
    pred = X @ w_manual
    loss = 0.5 * torch.mean((pred - y)**2)  # Mean over batch
    grad = manual_gradient(X, y, w_manual)
    w_manual = w_manual - alpha * grad
    losses_manual.append(loss.item())
    ws_manual.append(w_manual.clone())

# PyTorch gradient descent
w_torch = torch.zeros(2, requires_grad=True)
losses_torch = []
ws_torch = []
for step in range(max_iter):
    pred = X @ w_torch
    loss = 0.5 * torch.mean((pred - y)**2)  # Mean over batch
    loss.backward()
    
    with torch.no_grad():
        w_torch -= alpha * w_torch.grad
        w_torch.grad.zero_()
    
    losses_torch.append(loss.item())
    ws_torch.append(w_torch.clone())
```

The results reveal perfect agreement between manual and automatic gradient computation:

![Linear Regression Comparison](figures/linear_regression_comparison.png)

Both methods:
1. Converge to the same optimal weights
2. Follow identical trajectories
3. Achieve the same final loss value

This agreement confirms that PyTorch computes exact gradients, matching our manual calculations. The difference lies in convenience - PyTorch handles the gradient computation automatically, while we had to derive and implement the gradient formula manually.

For a more complex example, let's implement logistic regression on the MNIST dataset. We'll explore this in detail in the following section.

### MNIST Classification Example

The MNIST digit classification task compares logistic regression with neural networks. We focus on binary classification to determine whether a digit is odd or even. This demonstrates how PyTorch's automatic differentiation handles models of different complexity.

The implementation uses `torchvision.datasets.MNIST` for data loading and `transforms.Normalize` for preprocessing. Input images are normalized with MNIST's statistics (mean=0.1307, std=0.3081):

```python
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.1307,), (0.3081,))
])
train_dataset = datasets.MNIST('./data', train=True, transform=transform)
```

![MNIST Examples](figures/mnist_examples.png)
*Examples of MNIST digits. The models aims to identify the parity (odd/even) of each digit.*

The objective uses binary cross-entropy loss to measure the discrepancy between predicted probabilities and true labels:

$$ L(w) = -\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n [y_i \log p(y_i|x_i) + (1-y_i)\log(1-p(y_i|x_i))] $$

where $y_i$ indicates whether digit $i$ is odd (1) or even (0), and $$ p(y_i \mid x_i) $$ is the model's predicted probability. As before: 

$$
p(y_i = 1 \mid x_i) = \sigma(\text{model}(x_i)),
$$

where we use one of two models. First, logistic regression provides a baseline using a single linear layer:

```python
class Logistic(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = torch.nn.Linear(input_dim, 1, bias=False)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.sigmoid(self.linear(x))
```

The neural network extends this with a hidden layer and ReLU activation to learn nonlinear decision boundaries:

```python
class SimpleNN(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = torch.nn.Linear(784, 32)
        self.fc2 = torch.nn.Linear(32, 1)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        h = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        return torch.sigmoid(self.fc2(h))
```

We then train the model using PyTorch's automatic differentiation to compute gradients of the binary cross-entropy loss. The training loop follows three essential steps:

1. Forward Pass: Compute predictions and loss
   - Feed data through the model to get predictions
   - Calculate loss between predictions and true labels

2. Backward Pass: Compute gradients
   - Call `loss.backward()` to compute gradients through the computational graph
   - PyTorch automatically handles the chain rule through all operations

3. Parameter Update: Apply gradients
   - Zero out existing gradients to prevent accumulation from previous steps
   - Update each parameter using the computed gradients
   - The update follows $w \leftarrow w - \alpha \nabla L(w)$ where $\alpha$ is the learning rate

Here's the implementation:

```python
criterion = torch.nn.BCELoss()

def train_model(model, X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val, alpha=0.01, n_steps=1000):
    for step in range(n_steps):
        y_pred = model(X_train)
        loss = criterion(y_pred.squeeze(), y_train)
        
        loss.backward()
        
        with torch.no_grad():
            for param in model.parameters():
                param -= alpha * param.grad
                param.grad.zero_()
```

The neural network achieves 92.40% test accuracy versus logistic regression's 87.30%. This gap results from the neural network's ability to learn nonlinear decision boundaries.

*Examples misclassified by both models.*

Analysis of misclassified examples reveals patterns in model errors. The neural network performs better by learning features through its hidden layer to distinguish odd from even digits.

## Summary

This lecture explored how PyTorch's automatic differentiation system enables gradient computation for complex loss functions. Key takeaways include:

1. **Automatic Differentiation Basics**
   - PyTorch builds computational graphs during forward computation
   - Gradients flow backward through these graphs
   - The system computes exact gradients, matching manual calculations

2. **Common Pitfalls and Solutions**
   - Breaking computational graphs (solution: maintain tensor connections)
   - In-place operations (solution: create new tensors)
   - Gradient accumulation (solution: clear gradients between steps)
   - Memory management (solution: use `torch.no_grad()` when appropriate)

3. **From Simple to Complex Models**
   - Started with 1D polynomial example
   - Revisited least squares with automatic gradients
   - Extended to nonlinear regression and neural networks
   - Same principles apply across model complexity

4. **Practical Gradient Descent**
   - Four-step pattern: zero gradients â forward â backward â update
   - Modular design: swap models, losses, and optimizers

These tools form the foundation for modern deep learning. While we focused on relatively simple examples, the same principles scale to state-of-the-art models with millions of parameters. PyTorch's automatic differentiation makes this scaling possible by handling the complex task of gradient computation, letting practitioners focus on model design and optimization strategy.
