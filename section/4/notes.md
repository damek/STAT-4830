## Introduction

In our previous lecture, we explored gradient descent for minimizing the least squares objective. We saw how following the negative gradient leads us to the optimal solution, even for large-scale problems where direct methods fail. But least squares is just one example of a loss function. Modern machine learning employs a vast array of loss functions, each designed for specific tasks: cross-entropy for classification, Huber loss for robust regression, contrastive loss for similarity learning.

The power of PyTorch lies in its ability to compute gradients for any differentiable function constructed from its operations. This lecture explores how to harness this capability, starting with simple one-dimensional examples and building up to complex neural network losses. We'll see how PyTorch's automatic differentiation system tracks computations, computes gradients efficiently, and helps us avoid common pitfalls.

## Computing Gradients of Loss Functions

Let's start with the simplest possible case: computing the gradient of a one-dimensional function. Consider the polynomial:

$$ f(x) = x^3 - 3x $$

This function has an analytical gradient:

$$ \frac{d}{dx}f(x) = 3x^2 - 3 $$

While we can compute this derivative by hand, PyTorch offers a powerful alternative - automatic differentiation. Here's how it works:

```python
import torch

# Create input tensor with gradient tracking
x = torch.tensor([1.0], requires_grad=True)

# Define and compute function
def f(x):
    return x**3 - 3*x

y = f(x)

# Compute gradient
y.backward()

print(f"At x = {x.item():.1f}")
print(f"f(x) = {y.item():.1f}")
print(f"f'(x) = {x.grad.item():.1f}")  # Should be 3(1)Â² - 3 = 0
```

This simple example reveals the key components of automatic differentiation:

1. **Gradient Tracking**: We mark tensors that need gradients with `requires_grad=True`
2. **Forward Pass**: PyTorch records operations as we compute the function
3. **Backward Pass**: The `backward()` call computes gradients through the recorded operations
4. **Gradient Access**: The computed gradient is stored in the `.grad` attribute

Let's visualize how the function and its gradient behave:

![Polynomial and Gradient](figures/polynomial_gradient.png)

The top plot shows our function $f(x) = x^3 - 3x$, while the bottom plot compares PyTorch's computed gradient (red solid line) with the analytical gradient $3x^2 - 3$ (green dashed line). They match perfectly, confirming that PyTorch computes exact gradients.

### The Computational Graph

To understand how PyTorch computes these gradients, we need to examine the computational graph it builds during the forward pass:

![Computational Graph](figures/computational_graph.png)

Each node in this graph represents an operation:
1. Input node stores our value $x$
2. Power node computes $x^3$
3. Multiply node computes $-3x$
4. Add node combines terms to form $x^3 - 3x$
5. Gradient node computes derivatives during backward pass

During the forward pass, PyTorch:
1. Records each operation in sequence
2. Stores intermediate values
3. Maintains references between operations

During the backward pass, it:
1. Starts at the output node
2. Applies the chain rule through the graph
3. Accumulates gradients at each node
4. Stores the final result in `x.grad`

This graph structure explains a crucial requirement: we can only compute gradients through operations that PyTorch implements. The framework needs to know both:
1. How to compute the operation (forward pass)
2. How to compute its derivative (backward pass)

Common operations like addition (`+`), multiplication (`*`), and power (`**`) are all implemented by PyTorch. Even when we use Python's standard operators, we're actually calling PyTorch's overloaded versions that know how to handle both computation and differentiation.

### Common Pitfalls in Automatic Differentiation

While PyTorch's automatic differentiation is powerful, several common mistakes can break gradient computation or lead to unexpected behavior. Let's examine these pitfalls and their solutions:

![Common Pitfalls](figures/pitfalls.png)

#### 1. Breaking the Computational Graph

The most common mistake occurs when accidentally breaking the chain of computation that PyTorch uses to track gradients:

```python
# Wrong: breaks computational graph
x = torch.tensor([1.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x * 2
z = y.detach()  # Breaks the graph!
w = z * 3
w.backward()  # x.grad will be None

# Right: maintain computational graph
x = torch.tensor([1.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x * 2
w = y * 3
w.backward()  # x.grad will be 6
```

The `detach()` method creates a new tensor that shares the same data but detaches it from the computation history. This breaks the chain of operations needed for gradient computation. The top diagram shows correct gradient flow, while the middle diagram shows how `detach()` breaks this flow.

#### 2. In-Place Operations

In-place operations (modifying a tensor directly) can break gradient computation, as shown in the bottom diagram:

```python
# Wrong: in-place operation
x = torch.tensor([1.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x * 2
y += 1  # In-place operation breaks graph
y.backward()  # Error!

# Right: create new tensor
x = torch.tensor([1.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x * 2
y = y + 1  # Creates new tensor
y.backward()  # Works correctly
```

In-place operations modify the tensor's memory directly, which can invalidate the computational graph. Instead, create a new tensor to store the result.

#### 3. Gradient Accumulation

Gradients accumulate by default - if you don't clear them, multiple backward passes add up:

```python
x = torch.tensor([1.0], requires_grad=True)
for _ in range(3):
    y = x * 2
    y.backward()  # Gradients accumulate!
print(x.grad)  # Prints 6 (2 + 2 + 2)

# Solution: Clear gradients between computations
x = torch.tensor([1.0], requires_grad=True)
for _ in range(3):
    x.grad = None  # Clear gradients
    y = x * 2
    y.backward()
print(x.grad)  # Prints 2
```

This behavior is actually useful for accumulating gradients over multiple batches, but you need to be aware of it to avoid unintended accumulation.

#### 4. Scalar vs Vector Backward

PyTorch expects scalar outputs for `backward()` by default. For vector outputs, you need gradients of the same shape:

```python
# Wrong: vector output without gradient
x = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0]], requires_grad=True)
y = x * 2
y.backward()  # Error: grad can be implicitly created only for scalar outputs

# Right: provide gradient for vector output
x = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0]], requires_grad=True)
y = x * 2
y.backward(torch.ones_like(y))  # Works!
```

This requirement ensures that gradient computation is well-defined - for vector outputs, we need to specify how to weight each component's contribution to the gradient.

#### 5. Memory Management

Keeping computational graphs in memory can consume significant RAM. Use `torch.no_grad()` when you don't need gradients:

```python
# Wasteful: tracks gradients during evaluation
def evaluate(model, data):
    return model(data)

# Efficient: disables gradient tracking
def evaluate(model, data):
    with torch.no_grad():
        return model(data)
```

The `no_grad()` context manager temporarily disables gradient computation, reducing memory usage and speeding up computation when gradients aren't needed (like during model evaluation).

These pitfalls highlight important aspects of PyTorch's automatic differentiation:
1. The computational graph must remain connected
2. Operations must preserve gradient information
3. Memory management requires explicit consideration
4. Gradient computation needs well-defined scalar objectives

Understanding these issues helps write correct and efficient code for gradient-based optimization.

### Beyond One Dimension: Revisiting Least Squares

Our one-dimensional example demonstrated PyTorch's automatic differentiation on a simple function. Now let's return to the least squares problem we solved in the previous lecture, but this time using PyTorch's automatic differentiation. Given a data matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ and observations $y \in \mathbb{R}^n$, we minimize:

$$ f(w) = \frac{1}{2}\|Xw - y\|_2^2 = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i^\top w - y_i)^2 $$

In the previous lecture, we derived the gradient manually:

$$ \nabla f(w) = X^\top(Xw - y) $$

PyTorch can compute this gradient automatically:

```python
# Convert data to PyTorch tensors
X = torch.tensor(X_data, dtype=torch.float32)
y = torch.tensor(y_data, dtype=torch.float32)
w = torch.zeros(X.shape[1], requires_grad=True)  # Initialize weights

# Compute loss
predictions = X @ w
loss = 0.5 * torch.mean((predictions - y)**2)

# Compute gradient
loss.backward()
print(f"PyTorch gradient: {w.grad}")
```

To verify that PyTorch computes the correct gradient, we can compare it with our manual calculation:

![Least Squares Comparison](figures/least_squares_comparison.png)

The figure shows the contours of the least squares loss function for a simple 2D problem. At three different points (marked in red, blue, and green), we compute gradients using both manual calculation (left) and PyTorch's automatic differentiation (right). The arrows show the negative gradient direction at each point - the direction of steepest descent.

Several insights emerge from this comparison:

1. **Identical Results**: The gradient arrows match perfectly between manual and automatic computation, confirming that PyTorch computes exact gradients.

2. **Gradient Behavior**: The gradients point toward the optimum (marked with a black star), with longer arrows indicating steeper slopes.

3. **Loss Surface Structure**: The elliptical contours reveal the quadratic nature of the least squares objective, explaining the linear convergence we observed in gradient descent.

This example illustrates a key advantage of automatic differentiation: we can focus on defining our objective function naturally, letting PyTorch handle the gradient computation. The code becomes simpler and less error-prone, especially as we move to more complex loss functions.

### More Complex Loss Functions: Nonlinear Regression

While least squares provides a clean introduction to gradient computation, modern machine learning often involves more complex loss functions. Let's explore this by moving from linear to nonlinear regression. Instead of predicting outputs as a linear combination of inputs, we'll allow nonlinear transformations:

$$ f(x; w) = w_2^\top \tanh(W_1x + b_1) + b_2 $$

where $W_1, w_2$ are weight matrices and $b_1, b_2$ are bias terms. This model, despite its simple form, can approximate a wide range of nonlinear functions. The loss remains familiar:

$$ L(w) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (f(x_i; w) - y_i)^2 $$

but computing its gradient manually would be tedious. Each parameter's gradient requires careful application of the chain rule through the nonlinear transformation. PyTorch handles this automatically:

```python
class NonlinearModel(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear1 = torch.nn.Linear(1, 10)  # First layer: 1 â 10
        self.linear2 = torch.nn.Linear(10, 1)  # Second layer: 10 â 1
        
    def forward(self, x):
        h = torch.tanh(self.linear1(x))  # Nonlinear activation
        return self.linear2(h)           # Output layer

# Create model and compute gradients
model = NonlinearModel()
y_pred = model(X)
loss = torch.mean((y_pred - y)**2)
loss.backward()  # Computes gradients for ALL parameters
```

Let's see this model in action on a simple nonlinear regression task:

![Nonlinear Regression](figures/nonlinear_regression.png)

The figure reveals several key insights:

1. **Model Flexibility**: The neural network (red line) successfully learns the quadratic relationship (green dashed line) from noisy data (blue points).

2. **Training Dynamics**: The loss curve shows rapid initial improvement followed by fine-tuning, a common pattern in gradient-based optimization.

3. **Automatic Differentiation**: PyTorch computes gradients through the entire computation graph, including the nonlinear tanh activation, enabling end-to-end training.

This example demonstrates how PyTorch's automatic differentiation handles complex models with multiple layers and nonlinear transformations. The same principles extend to even more sophisticated architectures, like deep neural networks for image classification or natural language processing.

### From Logistic Regression to Neural Networks

In our first lecture, we introduced logistic regression for spam classification. The model made predictions using:

$$ p(y=1|x) = \sigma(w^\top x) $$

where $\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$ is the sigmoid function. We minimized cross-entropy loss:

$$ L(w) = -\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n [y_i \log p(y_i|x_i) + (1-y_i)\log(1-p(y_i|x_i))] $$

Neural networks extend this idea by allowing multiple layers of nonlinear transformations:

$$ p(y=1|x) = \sigma(w_2^\top \tanh(W_1x + b_1) + b_2) $$

The added nonlinearity enables the model to learn more complex decision boundaries. Let's see this in action on a synthetic classification problem:

```python
class NeuralClassifier(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size=10):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear1 = torch.nn.Linear(2, hidden_size)
        self.linear2 = torch.nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        h = torch.tanh(self.linear1(x))        # Nonlinear hidden layer
        return torch.sigmoid(self.linear2(h))   # Output probability

# Training with cross-entropy loss
y_pred = model(X)
loss = torch.nn.functional.binary_cross_entropy(y_pred, y)
loss.backward()  # Computes gradients through both layers
```

![Neural Classifier](figures/neural_classifier.png)

The figure demonstrates the power of neural networks:

1. **Complex Decision Boundary**: The model learns a nonlinear decision boundary (background colors) that separates the spiral-shaped classes (blue and red points). This would be impossible with logistic regression's linear boundary.

2. **Training Dynamics**: The right plot shows:
   - Loss decreasing steadily as the model learns
   - Accuracy improving as the decision boundary refines
   - Convergence to nearly perfect classification

3. **End-to-End Learning**: PyTorch's automatic differentiation computes gradients through both layers, handling the composition of:
   - Linear transformation ($W_1x + b_1$)
   - Nonlinear activation (tanh)
   - Another linear transformation ($w_2^\top h + b_2$)
   - Final sigmoid activation

This example illustrates how PyTorch makes it easy to experiment with different architectures. We can add layers, change activation functions, or modify the loss function - PyTorch handles all the gradient computations automatically.

## Applying Gradient Descent

With PyTorch's automatic differentiation handling gradient computation, we can implement gradient descent directly. The key is to remember that we're minimizing a loss function - finding parameters that make our predictions as accurate as possible. For any set of parameters $w$, we:

1. Compute the loss $L(w)$
2. Calculate its gradient $\nabla L(w)$
3. Take a step in the negative gradient direction: $w_{k+1} = w_k - \alpha \nabla L(w_k)$

Let's implement this pattern for linear regression, comparing manual gradient computation with PyTorch's automatic differentiation:

```python
# Generate synthetic data
X = torch.randn(100, 2)
w_true = torch.tensor([1.0, -0.5])
y = X @ w_true + 0.1 * torch.randn(100)

# Initialize parameters
w = torch.zeros(2, requires_grad=True)
alpha = 0.1  # Learning rate

# Manual gradient descent
def manual_gradient(X, y, w):
    return X.T @ (X @ w - y) / len(y)

w_manual = torch.zeros(2)
losses_manual = []

for step in range(100):
    # Compute gradient manually
    grad = manual_gradient(X, y, w_manual)
    
    # Update parameters
    w_manual = w_manual - alpha * grad
    
    # Track loss
    pred = X @ w_manual
    loss = 0.5 * torch.mean((pred - y)**2)
    losses_manual.append(loss.item())

# PyTorch gradient descent
w_torch = torch.zeros(2, requires_grad=True)
losses_torch = []

for step in range(100):
    # Forward pass
    pred = X @ w_torch
    loss = 0.5 * torch.mean((pred - y)**2)
    
    # Backward pass
    loss.backward()
    
    # Manual parameter update
    with torch.no_grad():
        w_torch -= alpha * w_torch.grad
        w_torch.grad.zero_()
    
    losses_torch.append(loss.item())

print("Manual weights:", w_manual)
print("PyTorch weights:", w_torch.detach())
print("True weights:", w_true)
```

The results reveal perfect agreement between manual and automatic gradient computation:

![Linear Regression Comparison](figures/linear_regression_comparison.png)

Both methods:
1. Converge to the same optimal weights
2. Follow identical trajectories
3. Achieve the same final loss value

This agreement confirms that PyTorch computes exact gradients, matching our manual calculations. The difference lies in convenience - PyTorch handles the gradient computation automatically, while we had to derive and implement the gradient formula manually.

For a more complex example, let's implement logistic regression on the MNIST dataset. We'll explore this in detail in the following section.

### MNIST Classification Example

Our journey from simple polynomial gradients to complex neural networks culminates in a practical application: classifying MNIST digits as odd or even. This binary classification task provides an ideal testbed for comparing logistic regression with neural networks, while showcasing PyTorch's automatic differentiation capabilities on real-world data.

Data preparation begins with PyTorch's built-in MNIST dataset loader. The `torchvision.datasets.MNIST` class handles downloading and initial preprocessing, while `transforms.Normalize` standardizes pixel values using MNIST's mean (0.1307) and standard deviation (0.3081). This normalization is crucial for stable training:

```python
import torch
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from torchvision import datasets, transforms

# Compose multiple transforms for consistent preprocessing
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(),           # Convert PIL images to tensors (0-1 range)
    transforms.Normalize((0.1307,), (0.3081,))  # Standardize using MNIST statistics
])

# Load MNIST with automatic download if needed
train_dataset = datasets.MNIST('./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
```

To keep our experiment focused and computationally efficient, we sample 5000 training examples, reserving the last 1000 for validation. The `torch.randperm` function generates random indices for unbiased sampling, ensuring our subset represents the full dataset distribution:

```python
n_samples, n_val = 5000, 1000  # Hyperparameters for dataset size
train_indices = torch.randperm(len(train_dataset))[:n_samples]
```

Converting MNIST's ten-class problem into binary classification requires careful data preprocessing. Our `get_binary_data` function performs three crucial transformations while maintaining memory efficiency:

```python
def get_binary_data(dataset, indices):
    """Transform MNIST digits into odd/even binary classification.
    
    Key transformations:
    1. Flatten 28x28 images to 784-dimensional vectors
    2. Convert labels to binary (odd=1, even=0)
    3. Preserve original images for visualization
    
    Memory management:
    - Uses list comprehension for efficient memory usage
    - Stacks tensors only after collecting all samples
    - Clones images to prevent memory sharing
    """
    X, y, raw_images = [], [], []
    subset = torch.utils.data.Subset(dataset, indices)
    
    for img, label in subset:
        X.append(img.view(-1))         # Flatten spatial dimensions
        y.append(label % 2)            # Convert to binary labels
        raw_images.append(img.clone())  # Store original image (deep copy)
    
    return (torch.stack(X),                           # Features: (N, 784)
            torch.tensor(y, dtype=torch.float32),     # Labels: (N,)
            torch.stack(raw_images))                  # Original images: (N, 1, 28, 28)
```

With our data prepared, we implement both logistic regression and a neural network classifier. The logistic regression model uses a linear layer followed by sigmoid activation, representing the simplest possible decision boundary:

```python
# Initialize logistic regression parameters
n_features = 784  # Flattened 28x28 image
w = torch.zeros(n_features, requires_grad=True)  # Weights initialized to zero
b = torch.zeros(1, requires_grad=True)          # Bias initialized to zero

def logistic_predict(X, w, b):
    """Compute logistic regression predictions.
    
    The computation graph:
    1. Linear transformation: X @ w + b
    2. Sigmoid activation: 1 / (1 + exp(-z))
    
    Gradient flow:
    - Backward pass computes âL/âw and âL/âb
    - Gradients flow through both linear and sigmoid operations
    """
    return torch.sigmoid(X @ w + b)  # Numerically stable sigmoid
```

Our neural network extends this with a hidden layer and nonlinear activation, enabling more complex decision boundaries:

```python
class SimpleNN(torch.nn.Module):
    """Neural network for binary MNIST classification.
    
    Architecture:
    - Input (784) â Linear â ReLU â Linear â Sigmoid
    - Hidden layer (32 units) captures nonlinear patterns
    - Output layer (1 unit) produces binary predictions
    
    Design choices:
    - ReLU activation: Faster training, no vanishing gradients
    - 32 hidden units: Balance between capacity and efficiency
    - Single hidden layer: Sufficient for this binary task
    """
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = torch.nn.Linear(784, 32)   # First learnable layer
        self.fc2 = torch.nn.Linear(32, 1)     # Output layer
        
        # Initialize weights using Xavier/Glorot initialization
        torch.nn.init.xavier_uniform_(self.fc1.weight)
        torch.nn.init.xavier_uniform_(self.fc2.weight)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        h = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))  # ReLU activation adds nonlinearity
        return torch.sigmoid(self.fc2(h))  # Sigmoid for binary output

neural_net = SimpleNN()
```

Training both models uses gradient descent with automatic differentiation. The process follows four key steps, with PyTorch handling the intricate details of gradient computation:

```python
def train_model(model, X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val, alpha=0.01, n_steps=1000):
    """Train a model while tracking performance metrics.
    
    Key PyTorch operations:

    - param.grad.zero_(): Reset gradients between steps
    
    Hyperparameters:
    - alpha=0.01: Conservative learning rate for stable training
    - n_steps=1000: Sufficient iterations for convergence
    """
    criterion = (torch.nn.BCELoss() if isinstance(model, tuple) 
                else torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss())
    
    metrics = {'train_loss': [], 'train_acc': [], 
              'val_loss': [], 'val_acc': [], 'iterations': []}
    
    for step in range(n_steps):
        # 1. Forward pass: compute predictions and loss
        if isinstance(model, tuple):
            w, b = model
            y_pred = logistic_predict(X_train, w, b)
            loss = criterion(y_pred, y_train)
        else:
            y_pred = model(X_train)
            loss = criterion(y_pred, y_train.long())
        
        # 2. Backward pass: compute gradients

        # 3. Update parameters using gradient descent
        with torch.no_grad():  # Disable gradient tracking for updates
            if isinstance(model, tuple):
                w -= alpha * w.grad  # Manual update for logistic regression
                b -= alpha * b.grad
                w.grad.zero_()  # Clear gradients for next iteration
                b.grad.zero_()
            else:
                for param in model.parameters():
                    param -= alpha * param.grad  # Update neural network parameters
                    param.grad.zero_()
        
        # 4. Track metrics (every 10 steps)
        if step % 10 == 0:
            metrics = update_metrics(model, X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val,
                                  metrics, step, criterion)
    
    return metrics

# Train both models with careful monitoring
logistic_metrics = train_model((w, b), X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val)
nn_metrics = train_model(neural_net, X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val)
```

After training, we analyze model performance through two lenses: quantitative metrics and qualitative analysis of misclassified examples. The neural network achieves 93.75% validation accuracy, outperforming logistic regression's 89.90%. This performance gap stems from the neural network's ability to learn nonlinear decision boundaries through its hidden layer.

To understand where our models struggle, we visualize misclassified examples with careful attention to memory management:

```python
def plot_misclassified_examples(model, X, y, raw_images, n_examples=5):
    """Visualize challenging examples with predictions.
    
    For each example, shows:

    2. True label (odd/even)
    3. Model's incorrect prediction
    
    Memory management:
    - Uses torch.no_grad() to prevent gradient computation
    - Releases tensors after use
    - Closes matplotlib figures explicitly
    """
    with torch.no_grad():  # Disable gradient tracking for inference

        mistakes = (predictions != y).nonzero().squeeze()
        
        fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, n_examples, figsize=(15, 3))
        for i, idx in enumerate(mistakes[:n_examples]):

![MNIST Misclassified Examples](figures/mnist_misclassified.png)

Examining these misclassified examples reveals common failure patterns that challenge both models:

1. **Ambiguous Shapes**: Even digits (like 4) that share structural similarities with odd ones (like 9), testing the models' ability to capture subtle geometric differences.

2. **Image Quality Issues**: Poor contrast or noise that obscures digit boundaries, highlighting the importance of robust feature extraction.

3. **Writing Style Variations**: Unusual digit formations that deviate from the training distribution, demonstrating the challenge of generalization.

4. **Geometric Transformations**: Extreme rotations or distortions that alter digit appearance while preserving parity, revealing invariance limitations.

The neural network's superior performance stems from three architectural advantages:

1. **Hierarchical Features**: The hidden layer learns progressively more abstract representations, from simple edges to complex digit parts.

2. **Nonlinear Transformations**: ReLU activation enables the model to learn curved decision boundaries that better separate odd from even digits.

3. **Increased Capacity**: Additional parameters allow the model to capture more variations in digit appearance while avoiding overfitting through careful regularization.

This practical example demonstrates how PyTorch's automatic differentiation seamlessly scales from simple functions to complex neural networks. The same fundamental principles - building computational graphs, computing gradients, and updating parameters - apply across model complexity. PyTorch handles all gradient computations automatically, letting us focus on model architecture and training dynamics while maintaining memory efficiency and numerical stability.

## Summary

This lecture explored how PyTorch's automatic differentiation system enables gradient computation for complex loss functions. Key takeaways include:

1. **Automatic Differentiation Basics**
   - PyTorch builds computational graphs during forward computation
   - Gradients flow backward through these graphs
   - The system computes exact gradients, matching manual calculations

2. **Common Pitfalls and Solutions**
   - Breaking computational graphs (solution: maintain tensor connections)
   - In-place operations (solution: create new tensors)
   - Gradient accumulation (solution: clear gradients between steps)
   - Memory management (solution: use `torch.no_grad()` when appropriate)

3. **From Simple to Complex Models**
   - Started with 1D polynomial example
   - Revisited least squares with automatic gradients
   - Extended to nonlinear regression and neural networks
   - Same principles apply across model complexity

4. **Practical Gradient Descent**
   - Four-step pattern: zero gradients â forward â backward â update
   - Modular design: swap models, losses, and optimizers
   - Important considerations: batching, learning rates, monitoring
   - Validation prevents overfitting

These tools form the foundation for modern deep learning. While we focused on relatively simple examples, the same principles scale to state-of-the-art models with millions of parameters. PyTorch's automatic differentiation makes this scaling possible by handling the complex task of gradient computation, letting practitioners focus on model design and optimization strategy.
